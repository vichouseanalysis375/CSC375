		 <h3>Project Description</h3>
			The overall scope of the project is to restructure and redesign the University 
of Victoria’s (Uvic) mobile application. Currently, UVic’s movile application 
does not match the design or function of the main UVic site. When accessing 
a resource on the application, the link will open within the mobile device’s 
browser not within the application. The main idea for the application is to 
redesign and modernize UVic’s mobile application, giving the application a 
new interface will allow it to better function as a useful student resource. The
new design will also match the interface design of UVic’s main website, 
allowing the application to be used seamlessly by staff and students; this is 
because there will be no need to relearn the application. There will also be 
an addition of a chat feature within the application, similar to the one of 
BrightSpace in order to better facilitate communication between students. 
This will be a very beneficial addition in terms of group collaboration, as well 
as not require students to create external forms of communication. This 
overall change to design of the mobile application will better benefit students
and staff in order for the application to be a useful resource.
